This is my first post on my new blog! How exciting!

I've needed a personal site/blog now for a long time now and after seeing no end of good things about GatsbyJS online, I decided to use it to create my own micro blog. I say 'micro blog', as some or all of my posts might be very short, but the point is to have a place online of my own to share my work, photos, thoughts, things I've learned and anything else I feel like.

I don't know if it's just my particular social media bubble but I've noticed a resurgence of people publishing on their own sites and also publishing RSS feeds so people can receive updates in whatever 'feed reader' they wish. For example, I use Feedly every day to keep up to date with news about the things I care about.

I quite like the way micro.blog puts it: "Today's social networks are broken. Ads are everywhere. Hate and harassment are too common. Fake news spreads unchecked. There's a better way: a network of independent microblogs. Short posts like tweets but on your own website that you control."

I can still cross-post to the social networks I use like Twitter and Instagram, hopefully automatically with services like micro.blog or IFTTT, but I haven't looked into that yet!

So stay tuned if you care, or don't ... whatever :)
