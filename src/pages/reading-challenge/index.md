![Reading Challenge](./books.jpg)

I set myself a challenge last year to read/listen to 20 books. I thought this would be quite a challenge for me as I thought I hadn't been reading as much as I used to, but I surprised myself by completing and surpassing it :)

A few of my favourites from last year include:

* The Kingkiller Chronicle series, can't wait for the final book of that trilogy
* The Red Rising series, currently reading the recently released fourth book Iron Gold.
* How To Stop Time
* The Gift of Fear,
* The Strange Death of Europe
* The start of Phillip Pullman's The Book of Dust series was great.
* Artemis

I've upped the challenge to 25 books for 2018. Follow me on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14971074-james) to see what I'm reading and how I'm getting on!
