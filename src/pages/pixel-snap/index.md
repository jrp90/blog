I bought this awesome little tool after seeing it launch on ProductHunt a few weeks ago and it's already been really useful for my work. Instead of having to use Cmd+Shift+4 to measure dimensions from designs, this tool allows me to measure anything on screen easily and with greater accuracy.

Activate it with a global hotkey and either click and drag around elements on screen to snap a rectangle around them or simply hover the cursor between elements and get measurements easily.

Their video explains the tool very well which you'll find on their [homepage](https://getpixelsnap.com/)
